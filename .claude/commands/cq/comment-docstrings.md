Run Ruff's pydocstyle rules and report missing or malformed docstrings.

## Steps

1. Run:
   ```
   ruff check --select D --output-format concise $ARGUMENTS
   ```
2. If ruff is not installed, install it: `pip install ruff --break-system-packages`
3. Summarize: which functions/classes/modules are missing docstrings,
   and which have formatting issues.
4. Do NOT auto-generate docstrings. Only report what's missing.
